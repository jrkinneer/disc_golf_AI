# Project description
For this project I want to train an AI to play disc golf.

## Plan
So far I think I want use either an reinforcement learning approach or a supervised learning (with classification)

I would also like to build a physical model for the AI to control, like a stick figure with some joints and a bit of freedom of motion. I think I can do this in unity and tie it to the code I'm writing here. not completely sure on this though, need to do more investigating
